## Problem description
Fashion MNIST dataset is a set of 70000 28x28 images of clothes.

![dataset sample](./images/fashion_mnist_3.0.1.png)

Our main goals:
* Create a neural network that correctly classifies which cloth type are we dealing with :smirk:
* Make this neural network as good as possible :sunglasses:
* Learn more about Deep Learning :grin:

## Loss graph

![loss](./images/loss.png)

We can see here that our CNN improves drastically over 1st epoch, we could reduce number of epochs and save computational time!

## Result we got

![result](./images/result.png)

Which is a whopping 95% accuracy!
